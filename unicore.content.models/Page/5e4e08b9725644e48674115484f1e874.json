The relationship eventually fell apart and Stephen left Mercy and married Anita with whom he had 7 children. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Stephen died, without writing a Will. After his burial, Susan and John were asked by relatives to leave the house their father built since their mother was not lawfully married to Stephen. According to the relatives, they do not belong to the family and hence have no right to any inheritance. Susan and John have no where to go.\r\n\r\n",
